1
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:10,982
hey' can you hear it?

2
00:24:10,983 --> 00:24:19,533
The clear' blue sky goes on and on

3
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:29,142
The ocean spans limitlessly

4
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:37,453
Please keep that smile on your face forever

5
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:44,015
Or else i'll cry

6
00:24:44,016 --> 00:24:47,852
You won't have to search around you

7
00:24:47,853 --> 00:24:51,864
It's all ok now.

8
00:24:51,890 --> 00:25:00,698
Everyone is inside this hand

9
00:25:00,699 --> 00:25:05,837
When you want to cry' and you want to run away

10
00:25:05,838 --> 00:25:10,408
When you forget what happiness is

11
00:25:10,409 --> 00:25:14,379
Just sing.

12
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:19,617
Light is born' and darkness was born

13
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:21,853
The two are one

14
00:25:21,854 --> 00:25:28,573
Harmonia' feel the telepathy

15
00:25:28,727 --> 00:25:34,171
Hey' can you hear it?

16
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:42,740
The 44th training field, also known as the forest of death.

17
00:25:42,741 --> 00:25:45,143
From here on it's a serious battle between the ninjas,

18
00:25:45,144 --> 00:25:46,720
Anything could happen!

19
00:25:46,912 --> 00:25:49,592
It's going down in earnest now!

20
00:25:50,716 --> 00:25:53,051
This is getting interesting!

21
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:55,353
A life risking survival game in the forest!

22
00:25:55,354 --> 00:25:57,499
I will survive without fail!

23
00:25:57,790 --> 00:26:01,626
Next time: "the chunin exam stage 2: the Forest of death!

24
00:26:01,627 --> 00:26:04,375
As for me, i'm going to kick butt again!
