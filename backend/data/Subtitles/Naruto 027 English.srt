1
00:00:15,174 --> 00:00:17,870
Press down hard on the gas

2
00:00:17,944 --> 00:00:21,812
That's right' there's no compromise

3
00:00:21,881 --> 00:00:25,874
We'll slip through the night

4
00:00:26,218 --> 00:00:28,709
At the final moment push hard

5
00:00:28,788 --> 00:00:32,849
That's right' all the way to zero'

6
00:00:32,925 --> 00:00:36,884
Until we wipe away the days

7
00:00:38,364 --> 00:00:43,097
Gently open your heart

8
00:00:43,803 --> 00:00:46,772
If you pull it close to you

9
00:00:49,208 --> 00:00:51,301
It will reach you' without a doubt

10
00:00:52,044 --> 00:00:53,341
It will come' closer

11
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:56,239
Now

12
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:09,660
We're speeding through life' squeezing it for all of its worth

13
00:01:09,862 --> 00:01:11,022
Our feet are tied

14
00:01:11,097 --> 00:01:14,897
But we still keep going farther

15
00:01:15,234 --> 00:01:20,433
Even if i take it back' and grasp it

16
00:01:20,706 --> 00:01:22,037
If you're not the one

17
00:01:22,108 --> 00:01:23,507
There will be no meaning

18
00:01:23,576 --> 00:01:29,845
And so we'll go far off into the distance.

19
00:01:53,806 --> 00:01:55,068
I like your determination!

20
00:01:56,308 --> 00:01:56,933
Then...

21
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:59,907
For those who are still here...

22
00:02:01,147 --> 00:02:02,705
the first test...

23
00:02:05,885 --> 00:02:07,910
you have passed it!

24
00:02:15,394 --> 00:02:17,055
You've passed through the gates!

25
00:02:18,397 --> 00:02:21,764
The first test for the chunin exams has been completed...

26
00:02:22,968 --> 00:02:25,960
i wish you well.

27
00:02:26,072 --> 00:02:28,734
All right! Wish us well!

28
00:02:33,379 --> 00:02:34,607
What a funny guy...

29
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:54,428
huh...

30
00:02:55,034 --> 00:02:57,025
i didn't think that there would be a guy who would pass the first test

31
00:02:57,103 --> 00:02:58,195
With a blank test sheet.

32
00:02:59,038 --> 00:03:03,065
Naruto uzumaki. He really is a funny guy.

33
00:03:25,631 --> 00:03:31,467
The chunin exam stage 2. The forest of death!

34
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:43,007
There's something kind of creepy about this place.

35
00:03:45,017 --> 00:03:49,647
This place is called the forest of death, you'll soon realize why.

36
00:03:52,424 --> 00:03:56,417
"The forest of death, you'll soon realize why."

37
00:03:56,695 --> 00:03:59,687
That kind of threat won't work on me one bit!

38
00:04:00,332 --> 00:04:01,959
I'm not scared!

39
00:04:03,202 --> 00:04:04,226
Really?

40
00:04:04,637 --> 00:04:06,764
You've got a lot of energy.

41
00:04:13,512 --> 00:04:17,414
A kid like you dies at very beginning,

42
00:04:19,752 --> 00:04:22,983
Dappled with the red blood i like.

43
00:04:30,563 --> 00:04:33,054
I'm returning your... kunai knife...

44
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:35,460
thank you for taking the trouble...

45
00:04:43,809 --> 00:04:48,109
But... don't stand behind me, thirsty for blood.

46
00:04:49,648 --> 00:04:51,843
If you don't want a quick death...

47
00:04:54,053 --> 00:04:58,615
well, it's my nature to act up at the sight of red blood.

48
00:04:59,692 --> 00:05:04,527
And my precious hair was cut, so i got excited...

49
00:05:06,198 --> 00:05:07,130
naruto...

50
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,067
i'm sorry...

51
00:05:11,704 --> 00:05:13,934
w what with that proctor?

52
00:05:14,506 --> 00:05:15,803
Frankly' she's psycho!

53
00:05:16,675 --> 00:05:18,040
This one' too...

54
00:05:20,012 --> 00:05:22,207
that girl' why was her tongue so long?

55
00:05:23,983 --> 00:05:28,147
Evidently, we've got a lot of hot blooded kids this time.

56
00:05:30,723 --> 00:05:32,088
This will be fun.

57
00:05:32,892 --> 00:05:35,918
You're the most hot blooded! Believe it!

58
00:05:38,264 --> 00:05:43,896
Well, before we start the second exam, i have to pass this out to you!

59
00:05:50,342 --> 00:05:51,366
It's a consent form,

60
00:05:51,877 --> 00:05:55,745
Before you can take part in the test you have to sign this.

61
00:05:55,915 --> 00:05:56,711
Why?

62
00:05:57,349 --> 00:05:59,681
F-Rom here on out, corpses are going to come out,

63
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:02,309
I have to get your consent to that!

64
00:06:02,955 --> 00:06:05,321
Or it'll be my responsibility.

65
00:06:13,565 --> 00:06:16,500
Well, i'm going to start the explanation for the second exam.

66
00:06:16,902 --> 00:06:21,271
In a word, the limits of your survival will be challenged.

67
00:06:24,777 --> 00:06:29,146
Survival' huh? This test is a total pain.

68
00:06:29,548 --> 00:06:33,746
F-Irst, i'll give you step-By -Step instruction on the terrain of this training f-Ield.

69
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,419
Training field number 44 is surrounded by 44 locked entrance gates,

70
00:06:39,491 --> 00:06:43,951
There are rivers and a forest and a tower in the middle.

71
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:47,424
It's about 10 kilometers from the towers to the gate...

72
00:06:48,133 --> 00:06:52,729
in this confined area, you will go through a certain survival program.

73
00:06:54,907 --> 00:06:56,602
The contents of which are...

74
00:07:00,779 --> 00:07:03,942
anything goes scroll battle!

75
00:07:04,984 --> 00:07:05,882
Scroll...?

76
00:07:05,951 --> 00:07:06,849
Yes...

77
00:07:08,087 --> 00:07:13,548
i want you to fight for two scrolls, the heaven scroll and the earth scroll.

78
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:21,627
All together 26 teams got through the fiirst test.

79
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:23,534
HaIf of them...

80
00:07:23,602 --> 00:07:29,040
13 teams get the heaven scroll, the other haIf get the earth scroll.

81
00:07:29,241 --> 00:07:31,801
I'll hand over one scroll to each team.

82
00:07:32,478 --> 00:07:35,208
To put it simply, that 'swhat you 're vying for.

83
00:07:36,015 --> 00:07:38,347
And the conditions to pass?

84
00:07:38,884 --> 00:07:43,548
Three of you bring both the heaven and earth scrolls to the tower in the center.

85
00:07:43,956 --> 00:07:49,861
That means that of the 13 teams, haIf of them will fail for sure...

86
00:07:50,229 --> 00:07:52,197
Ex. Cept it has to be in time.

87
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:55,994
For this second exam, the time limit is 120 hours.

88
00:07:56,435 --> 00:07:58,767
Do it in exactly fiive days!

89
00:07:58,871 --> 00:07:59,838
F-Ive days.

90
00:07:59,905 --> 00:08:01,532
What do we do about food?

91
00:08:01,607 --> 00:08:04,906
Be seIf sufficient! It's a treasure trove in the wilderness.

92
00:08:05,244 --> 00:08:06,905
There's more than enough for food...

93
00:08:07,413 --> 00:08:08,402
however...

94
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:11,139
it's teeming with fierce people eating animals,

95
00:08:11,417 --> 00:08:14,250
Poison bugs, poisonous weeds and much more.

96
00:08:14,586 --> 00:08:16,019
Noway...

97
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:19,318
f-Ool, that 'swhy it 's called survival!

98
00:08:19,792 --> 00:08:25,128
Besides, it's improbable that 39 people, 13 teams will pass.

99
00:08:25,731 --> 00:08:28,495
The interval for activity gets longer with passing each day,

100
00:08:28,734 --> 00:08:32,135
While the time for recovery gets shorter...

101
00:08:32,504 --> 00:08:34,199
seems pretty grueling!

102
00:08:36,241 --> 00:08:38,573
On top of that, you're surrounded by nothing but enemies,

103
00:08:38,677 --> 00:08:41,271
Even falling asleep will be a problem...

104
00:08:41,647 --> 00:08:45,708
and, besides those injured during attempts to capture scrolls...

105
00:08:46,118 --> 00:08:47,881
therewill defiinitely be people

106
00:08:47,953 --> 00:08:50,888
Are unable to endure the rigors of the course.

107
00:08:51,523 --> 00:08:54,981
Umm... so you can quit in the middle of it?

108
00:08:55,627 --> 00:08:58,994
According to the rules, you cannot give up in the middle of it!

109
00:08:59,465 --> 00:09:02,628
I want you to spend five days in the forest.

110
00:09:03,135 --> 00:09:04,966
Just like i thought...

111
00:09:05,571 --> 00:09:07,664
this is going to be a pain!

112
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:11,108
Moving on, conditions of disqualification.

113
00:09:11,677 --> 00:09:15,545
Number 1, if all three members of the team can't make it to the tower

114
00:09:15,614 --> 00:09:18,708
With the heaven and earth scrolls within the time limit.

115
00:09:19,685 --> 00:09:25,885
Number 2, if a team loses a member or if a member became incapacitated.

116
00:09:26,658 --> 00:09:28,683
There's that, and this is a supplement...

117
00:09:29,061 --> 00:09:31,529
absolutely do not look at the contents of the scrolls

118
00:09:31,597 --> 00:09:33,622
Until you have reached the tower!

119
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:37,559
W what happens if we look at it haIfway through?

120
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:42,937
When you look at it you'll find... out!

121
00:09:43,442 --> 00:09:44,340
Huh?

122
00:09:45,844 --> 00:09:49,974
There are times when a chunin must deal with super secret text.

123
00:09:50,249 --> 00:09:52,149
This is to test your reliability.

124
00:09:52,651 --> 00:09:53,675
That's all the explanation!

125
00:09:53,952 --> 00:09:57,183
I'll exchange your three consent forms for the scrolls in that hut over there.

126
00:09:57,923 --> 00:10:02,019
After that, pick your entrance, and all the gates will open simultaneously!

127
00:10:05,664 --> 00:10:08,098
F-Inally, just aword of advice...

128
00:10:09,368 --> 00:10:10,130
don't die!

129
00:10:35,894 --> 00:10:40,354
I see' so you won't know which scroll was given to each team...

130
00:10:40,599 --> 00:10:45,332
and you won't know which of the three people is carrying the scroll.

131
00:10:46,371 --> 00:10:48,100
If what lbiki said was right'

132
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:52,470
There will be life or death struggles for information in this test.

133
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,806
Everyone is an enemy!

134
00:11:00,052 --> 00:11:01,883
The resolve of everyone here is strong.

135
00:11:03,088 --> 00:11:05,147
That means that it might come to killing each other.

136
00:11:08,393 --> 00:11:11,328
It looks like they understand the meaning of the consent form a little bit...

137
00:11:16,201 --> 00:11:18,499
heeey, lookwho 's here!

138
00:11:18,704 --> 00:11:21,036
It's billboard brow, isn't it?

139
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:27,039
I thought you went home long ago, i never imagined you were still here.

140
00:11:27,646 --> 00:11:31,776
Ooooh? Lookwho 's here, the ugly inopig.

141
00:11:32,117 --> 00:11:35,746
Starting now, it 's fiive days of the survival testwith sasuke.

142
00:11:35,988 --> 00:11:38,252
There's no reason to go home.

143
00:11:41,927 --> 00:11:42,757
- Ugly! - Billboard!

144
00:11:42,828 --> 00:11:43,795
- Ugly! Ugly! - Billboard! Billboard!

145
00:11:43,862 --> 00:11:45,386
- Ugly, ugly, ugly! - Billboard, billboard, billboard!

146
00:11:45,464 --> 00:11:47,159
- Billboard, billboard, billboard! - Ugly ugly ugly!

147
00:11:47,232 --> 00:11:49,223
- Ugly, ugly, ugly, ugly! - Billboard, billboard, billboard, billboard!

148
00:11:49,601 --> 00:11:51,364
Sakura, this is impossible for you.

149
00:11:51,436 --> 00:11:53,904
For your own sake, just hurry up and go home!

150
00:11:54,306 --> 00:11:56,365
I could say the exact same thing to you!

151
00:12:03,382 --> 00:12:06,715
Hey, why are those two on such bad terms?

152
00:12:07,219 --> 00:12:10,416
D-Do you think i care about something stupid like that?

153
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:16,056
Man... all there is to do is write my name,

154
00:12:16,128 --> 00:12:18,119
Why does it take this much time!

155
00:12:20,065 --> 00:12:23,125
Hey! Hinata! What are you doing over there?

156
00:12:24,836 --> 00:12:26,098
N-Naruto...

157
00:12:26,972 --> 00:12:29,338
Umm... uhhhh..Well...

158
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:32,605
just like i thought' this kid is strange.

159
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,374
A scratch...

160
00:12:35,681 --> 00:12:38,946
Uh um... this... is

161
00:12:39,017 --> 00:12:39,984
See ya!

162
00:12:45,457 --> 00:12:46,583
Naruto...

163
00:12:49,127 --> 00:12:51,823
it's about time for the scroll exchange.

164
00:13:04,176 --> 00:13:07,009
Well' i wonder how many teams will survive...

165
00:13:19,991 --> 00:13:21,788
teamswho have taken the scroll,

166
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:24,852
Stay with the representative and move to the gate!

167
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:27,931
We'll all start simultaneously in 30 minutes!!

168
00:13:39,745 --> 00:13:43,340
Yeah! Survival is our forte!

169
00:13:43,515 --> 00:13:45,915
Hinata, don't show your weakness.

170
00:13:47,119 --> 00:13:47,915
Uh, okay...

171
00:13:48,987 --> 00:13:50,249
life or death...

172
00:13:50,622 --> 00:13:53,022
it's a pain but we just have to do this.

173
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:55,650
Since it's come to this, naruto will be our target.

174
00:13:56,027 --> 00:13:58,962
For snacks, there's potato chips...

175
00:13:59,131 --> 00:14:00,655
- what about shortcake.? - I can't believe you two!

176
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:04,694
Okaay! I won't lose!

177
00:14:05,137 --> 00:14:08,573
I'll bring down whoever comes near me.

178
00:14:08,707 --> 00:14:11,938
- Yes! - Cha!

179
00:14:16,214 --> 00:14:18,842
Heh heh... fiinally the opportunity is here...

180
00:14:19,351 --> 00:14:22,616
we have the chance to fuIfill our mission in earnest...

181
00:14:29,294 --> 00:14:30,818
sure' the enemy teams are scary but'

182
00:14:31,596 --> 00:14:34,429
I'm really scared of spending five days with this guy.

183
00:14:37,135 --> 00:14:39,330
Target the rookies first.

184
00:14:40,172 --> 00:14:42,265
They said that from now on it's okay to kill,

185
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,773
Which makes it easier.

186
00:14:46,945 --> 00:14:52,144
Master guy' i'll do my best! I'll definitely succeed!

187
00:15:05,564 --> 00:15:10,297
We now start the second test of the chunin ex. Am!

188
00:15:14,739 --> 00:15:15,899
Look for the brats!

189
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:17,675
Those three, right?

190
00:15:19,945 --> 00:15:22,209
All right! Let's go!

191
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:34,886
Okay! First, we search for that thing.

192
00:15:35,227 --> 00:15:36,592
Can you do it, hinata?

193
00:15:36,962 --> 00:15:37,587
Yes.

194
00:15:41,132 --> 00:15:41,996
Byakugan!

195
00:15:45,303 --> 00:15:48,500
Slow down, lee! We just started.

196
00:15:48,974 --> 00:15:51,101
I know. But...

197
00:15:52,544 --> 00:15:53,977
i can't stay still!

198
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:56,903
Who knows what kind of powerful foe is waiting for us.

199
00:15:58,884 --> 00:16:00,215
Hot-Blooded fool...

200
00:16:01,353 --> 00:16:04,049
as you already understand, we have only one target!

201
00:16:19,271 --> 00:16:21,637
W what are you doing, choji?

202
00:16:24,009 --> 00:16:28,036
Just a little break... i'm already tired, and hungry...

203
00:16:28,446 --> 00:16:31,142
what are you suddenly saying?!

204
00:16:31,516 --> 00:16:34,076
It hasn't been five minutes since we started!

205
00:16:34,819 --> 00:16:37,947
But i can't help it. I'm hungry...

206
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:41,926
you! If you were able to bring snacks,

207
00:16:41,993 --> 00:16:45,759
You should have been able to bring one k unai knife!

208
00:16:46,064 --> 00:16:46,894
Ino! Hide!

209
00:17:02,881 --> 00:17:03,745
Uh oh!

210
00:17:14,225 --> 00:17:16,591
This kind of thing continuing for five days...?

211
00:17:26,037 --> 00:17:29,803
Anyway, the tower is the goal for everyone, right?

212
00:17:30,542 --> 00:17:34,103
So it would be clever for us to make a trap in the vicinity of the tower.

213
00:17:35,714 --> 00:17:38,547
Okay..Wasting no time, huh?

214
00:17:39,317 --> 00:17:40,147
Where are they?

215
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,015
Heh... kids.

216
00:17:44,556 --> 00:17:47,650
It's like begging to be found, standing in that conspicuous place.

217
00:17:47,892 --> 00:17:50,122
They sensed our presence,

218
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:54,028
But, evidently they haven't grasped where we are.

219
00:17:55,433 --> 00:17:57,492
What happened? You're pale.

220
00:18:01,139 --> 00:18:02,538
W what is that?!

221
00:18:13,018 --> 00:18:16,510
The flying leeches of leaf village sense body temperature and perspiration,

222
00:18:16,588 --> 00:18:18,488
Then in mass, swoop down on their prey.

223
00:18:19,257 --> 00:18:21,521
If they continue to suck your blood for five minutes,

224
00:18:21,593 --> 00:18:22,787
You go to the other world...

225
00:18:23,662 --> 00:18:25,425
using this behavior,

226
00:18:25,497 --> 00:18:28,057
We'd set a trap on the path enemies would use to escape.

227
00:18:28,667 --> 00:18:31,067
D-Darn it...

228
00:18:37,308 --> 00:18:38,605
that's one team gone!

229
00:18:48,286 --> 00:18:50,117
It sounds like they've already started.

230
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:55,855
Wasn't that someone screaming just now?

231
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:04,227
I i'm kinda getting nervous.

232
00:19:04,836 --> 00:19:09,102
I it was nothing. Sakura. Believe it!

233
00:19:11,476 --> 00:19:13,740
I i have to pee...

234
00:19:14,446 --> 00:19:15,970
Y you... fool!

235
00:19:16,381 --> 00:19:18,941
What are you doing in front of a lady!

236
00:19:19,184 --> 00:19:20,549
Go to the grass!

237
00:19:27,225 --> 00:19:30,820
Aah, that was a lot! I'm refreshed.

238
00:19:30,962 --> 00:19:33,897
Like i said, not in front of a lady!

239
00:19:39,871 --> 00:19:43,363
S sasuke... no matter what, you don't have to go that far.

240
00:19:44,709 --> 00:19:45,903
W what was that for...?

241
00:19:56,955 --> 00:19:59,355
What are you doing... all of a sudden?!

242
00:19:59,624 --> 00:20:02,525
What you ask? That's my line, isn't it?

243
00:20:02,961 --> 00:20:03,689
Sasuke!

244
00:20:04,562 --> 00:20:06,189
It can't be helped!

245
00:20:18,643 --> 00:20:20,611
Sasuke, please stop!

246
00:20:21,246 --> 00:20:22,508
Look closely at him!

247
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:28,116
Talk! Where's the real naruto!

248
00:20:29,487 --> 00:20:32,115
I have no idea what you're talking about!

249
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:33,757
What happened to the scratch on you face?

250
00:20:36,961 --> 00:20:40,954
I'm asking what happened to the scratch you got before from the proctor!

251
00:20:41,499 --> 00:20:45,094
And your shuriken holster is on your left leg.

252
00:20:45,603 --> 00:20:47,070
That guy's right handed!

253
00:20:49,374 --> 00:20:53,401
You 'reworse at transforrmation than naruto, you phony!

254
00:20:56,047 --> 00:20:59,778
Unlucky! You got me. In that case...

255
00:21:00,485 --> 00:21:02,510
which one of you got the scroll?

256
00:21:05,156 --> 00:21:08,887
If you listen to me obediently, i'll spare your lives.

257
00:21:14,732 --> 00:21:18,498
I see! Then i'll resort to force!

258
00:21:28,646 --> 00:21:33,242
Hey' can you hear it?

259
00:21:33,351 --> 00:21:41,451
The clear' blue sky goes on and on

260
00:21:42,527 --> 00:21:51,060
The ocean spans limitlessly

261
00:21:51,669 --> 00:21:59,371
Please keep that smile on your face forever

262
00:22:00,778 --> 00:22:06,307
Or else i'll cry

263
00:22:06,384 --> 00:22:10,150
You won't have to search around you

264
00:22:10,221 --> 00:22:13,782
It's all ok now.

265
00:22:14,259 --> 00:22:22,667
Everyone is inside this hand

266
00:22:23,067 --> 00:22:28,130
When you want to cry' and you want to run away

267
00:22:28,206 --> 00:22:32,609
When you forget what happiness is

268
00:22:32,777 --> 00:22:36,440
Just sing.

269
00:22:36,748 --> 00:22:41,845
Light is born' and darkness was born

270
00:22:41,986 --> 00:22:44,113
The two are one

271
00:22:44,222 --> 00:22:50,491
Harmonia' feel the telepathy

272
00:22:51,095 --> 00:22:56,089
Hey' can you hear it?

273
00:23:01,472 --> 00:23:03,667
Aww, stupid gas mask man!

274
00:23:04,175 --> 00:23:06,803
Suddenly sneaking up on someone when they're peeing!

275
00:23:06,911 --> 00:23:08,845
I messed up just a little bit.

276
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:11,210
Now i have to hurry and meet up with sakura.

277
00:23:11,316 --> 00:23:13,750
Wait a minute! What is this giant snake?

278
00:23:13,851 --> 00:23:16,445
Hey! Are you serious?! Wait a minute, hey!

279
00:23:17,855 --> 00:23:19,288
i've been gulped down!

280
00:23:20,591 --> 00:23:23,890
Next episode: "eat or be eaten: panic in the Forest"

281
00:23:24,195 --> 00:23:26,959
Will i return to action?!
